These set of files are made to create final health reports for participants. 
It is fully automated, the only rewuired fields are excel files produced by the VO2 bike machine, DXA scan PDF file, resting heart rate, and age. 
To fully complete/fill the health reports, the other fields must be entered.
Sample files here are produced by my PI Dr.Ortega Santos.
Created as part of my job as a Research Assistant working under Dr.Carmen Ortega-Santos at the FITgut lab. 

To run the program, open "Final_Reprt_Maker.R", and run the code manually, or click the small button on the top right that is written "run"
select corresponding files, adding values.
Then the report will be made.
